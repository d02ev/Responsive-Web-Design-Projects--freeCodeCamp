                <p id="info"><strong> Ratan Naval Tata </strong> (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist,
                    philanthropist,
                    and a former chairman
                    of Tata Sons. He was also chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim chairman,
                    from
                    October 2016 through February 2017, and continues to head its charitable trusts. He is the recipient
                    of two of the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan (2000).
                    He
                    is well known for his business ethics and philanthropy. <br>

                    Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and great-grandson of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of
                    Tata
                    Group. He is an alumnus of the Cornell University College of Architecture and Harvard Business
                    School
                    through the Advanced Management Program that he completed in 1975. He joined his company in 1961
                    when he
                    used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon
                    the
                    latter's retirement in 1991. During Ratan Tata's chairmanship of 21 years, revenues grew over 40
                    times,
                    and
                    profit, over 50 times. He got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover,
                    and
                    Tata Steel to acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centrist group into a
                    global
                    business.</p>
