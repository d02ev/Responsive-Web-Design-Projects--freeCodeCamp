                <p class="intro-para">Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
                    Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
                    whitespace.
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
                    code
                    for smalland large-scale projects.</p>

                <p class="intro-para">Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
                    programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and
                    functional programming. Python is often
                    described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

                <p class="intro-para">Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van
                    Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new
                    features, such as list
                    comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with
                    version 2.7 in 2020. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not
                    completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.</p>

                Python supports cross-platform operating systems which makes building applications with it all the more

                Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no
                command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                <p class="example">Example:
                    <code class="code-snip">
                        <span class="newline">>>> x = 5</span>
                        <span class="newline">>>> y = "John"</span>
                        <span class="newline"></span>
                        <span class="newline">>>> print(x)</span>
                        <span class="newline">>>> print(y)</span>
                    </code>
                </p>
                String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
                <p class="example">Example:
                    <code class="code-snip">
                        <span class="newline">>>> x = "John"</span>
                        <span class="ex-diff-col newlinw"><span class="sa-dif-col">>>></span> # is the same as</span>
                        <span class="newline">>>> x = 'John'</span>
                    </code>
                </p>

                Variable Names
            </p>
            <p class="sec-subinfo">
                A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
                Rules for Python variables:
                <ul>
                    <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.</li>
                    <li>A variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
                    <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
                    </li>
                    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example">Example:
                    <code class="code-snip">
                        <span class=" ex-diff-col newline"><span class="sa-dif-col">>>></span> #Legal variable names:</span>

                Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Equals: <span class="diff-col">a == b</span></li>
                    <li>Not Equals: <span class="diff-col">a != b</span></li>
                    <li>Less than: <span class="diff-col">a < b</span> </li> <li>Less than or equal to: <span
                                    class="diff-col">a <= b</span> </li> <li>Greater than: <span class="diff-col">a >
                                            b</span></li>
                    <li>Greater than or equal to: <span class="diff-col">a >= b</span></li>
                </ul>
                These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

                An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
                <p class="example">Example:
                    <code class="code-snip">
                        <span class="newline">>>> a = 33</span>

                            <span class="identation">print('b is greater than a')</span>

                    Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code.
                    Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
                    <p class="example">Example:
                        <code class="code-snip">

                    The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this
